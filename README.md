# Bloom V1

Bloom is a powerful and flexible automation tool designed to help you automate repetitive tasks with ease. It records your keyboard and mouse inputs, then lets you play them back exactly as they happened — perfect for saving time and effort.

What makes Bloom stand out is its custom Bloom Signal Editor, a unique feature that allows users to create and customize their own automation events, called mangos. Whether you're automating daily tasks, setting up complex workflows, or testing applications, Bloom gives you full control with a clean interface and advanced customization options.

Built using the experience gained from tools like TinyTask, Bloom is designed to be faster, more customizable, and more powerful — made for users who want more control over their automations.

Bloom is lightweight, easy to use, and built for power users, developers, gamers, and anyone who wants to simplify their work through smart automation.
